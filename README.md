# Laserduino
Just another torch driver for Arduino.
You just have to plug the light to pin 3 and a button to pin 2. That's it.

## Instructions

One short press: switch the light on or off.
Long press: change the brightness of the light: the first time you press it, the light will dim until you stop pressing it, the second time will do the opposite of the first! *omg that's technology*.

This project was created to drive a 50mW laser diode that I've found in my drawer.
